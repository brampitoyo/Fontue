# FONTUE - THE OPEN SOURCE WEB FONT SERVER 
##############################################################
#
# Fontue is a Rack-based, open-source, 
# web font server built for Kernest.com
#
# For the latest version of this code visit: 
# http://github.com/garrickvanburen/fontue
#
# For more information about Rack: 
# http://rack.rubyforge.org/
#
# Fontue's goals:
#
# - Keep @font-face declarations clean, readable, and cross-browswer compatible.
#
# - Serve the appropriate font format (otf/ttf, eot, svg, or woff) to browsers supporting @font-face.
#
# - Save bandwidth by effectively setting cache headers.
#
# - Save bandwidth by not sending fonts to user agents that don't 
#   support @font-face.
#
# - Save bandwidth by not sending fonts to requests that shouldn't 
#   receive the font (domain checking).
#
# - Serve fonts really fast.

#
# TO INSTALL AND RUN FONTUE
#
# 1. Create a directory on your server for your web fonts. And update the font_server_directory variable in line 93. Default is '/fonts'.
#
# 2. Upload your web fonts into a directory to your server - say '/fonts' 
#    - Safari, Chrome, Firefox, and Opera like .otf & .ttf fonts
#    - Mobile Safari and early versions of Chrome prefer .svg fonts
#    - Later versions of Firefox also like .woff fonts
#
# 3. Upload fontue.ru to your server
#    Depending on the server you're using, you may also need a config.yml file.
#
# 4. Configure your Rack-compliant web server (i.e. Thin, Ebb, Lighttpd, etc) and Run: rackup fontue.ru
#    Fontue can also be easily adapted for use as an endpoint within Ruby on Rails' Metal.
#
# 5. Fontue will now be accepting requests on your server at: /font (change this in line 189)
